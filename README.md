ASAP Application Development - To-Do List
1. Project Setup & Environment:
Create a project and launch the ASAP idea:
Learn how to initialize a new project, set up a repository on GitHub, and deploy the initial version of your ASAP application.

Set up your development environment:
Install all necessary software and tools (like Node.js, npm, and your code editor) to work on your project. Make sure your development environment is ready for both front-end and back-end development.

2. API Development:
Build your first API and page:
Start by creating your first simple API endpoint and create a page to interact with it.

Deploy the API (local and production):
Learn how to deploy your API both locally for development purposes and in a production environment for the live application.

Test your API using an API client and database:
Use tools like Postman to test your API endpoints and ensure that they’re interacting correctly with your database.

Write a Mongoose schema for any ASAP application schema:
Define and write a Mongoose schema for any entity in your ASAP application, like users or tasks, that needs to be stored in MongoDB.

Set up the database and connect it to the Express server:
Learn how to configure a database (like MongoDB) and connect it with your Express.js server to store and retrieve data.

Modify data in the DB through your API using an API client:
Practice making API requests that add, update, or delete data in your database using an API client.

3. Front-End Development:
Set up a simple React app using Vite:
Learn how to quickly set up a React app using Vite as your build tool, which will speed up development and hot reloading.

Deploy the React front-end:
Deploy your React app to a platform like Vercel or Netlify to make it publicly accessible.

Design a component for your entity:
Design and create a reusable React component that represents an entity (e.g., a user, product, or task).

Display a list of entities using the component:
Implement functionality that allows your component to display a list of entities fetched from the back-end.

Implement insert functionality in the React app:
Add functionality to your app that allows users to insert new entities into the database through a form.

Implement update functionality in the React app:
Add a feature where users can edit and update existing entities in the database through the React app.

Implement delete functionality in the React app:
Add a feature that allows users to delete entities from the database.

4. User Management & Security:
Add users to the DB via Bruno and validate them:
Learn how to add users to your database using tools like Bruno, and validate user data.

Securely store passwords and manage sessions:
Learn best practices for securely storing user passwords (e.g., using bcrypt) and saving session data (like the username) in session storage on the front end.

5. Optional Advanced Topics:
Firebase Authentication (optional):
Learn how to integrate Firebase Authentication to manage users and their authentication securely.

Background jobs (optional):
Learn about background jobs and how to implement them to handle tasks that should run asynchronously (e.g., email notifications, image processing).

Caching (optional):
Learn how to implement caching strategies to improve performance and reduce server load.

Benchmarking and scaling (optional):
Learn about the performance of your app and how to scale it effectively to handle more users or requests.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) (optional):
Learn how to implement SSR to improve SEO and initial page load performance for React apps.

Docker (optional):
Learn how to containerize your application using Docker, making it easier to deploy and manage your application across different environments.

This detailed list will guide you step-by-step as you learn and implement various aspects of your ASAP application, from setting up your environment to building and deploying your app. The optional topics provide you with advanced skills for a more in-depth understanding and enhanced features. Let me know if you need more details or further customization!
